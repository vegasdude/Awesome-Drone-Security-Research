Perfect — here’s a clean, professional way to build an “Awesome Drone Security Research” repo that’s credible, legal, and actually useful.

This is not hacking-for-chaos — it’s defensive research, auditing, and resilience 🛡️🛸


---

📌 Repo name (recommended)

Choose one:

awesome-drone-security-research ✅ (best)

awesome-drone-security

awesome-uas-security

awesome-uav-cybersecurity


Description:

> Curated resources for drone (UAS/UAV) security research, firmware analysis, RF resilience, simulation, and defensive testing.




---

⭐ What to do first on GitHub

1. Fork the original Awesome Drone Hacking repo


2. Rename your fork to one of the names above


3. Edit README.md


4. Add a clear legal & ethical disclaimer

🧠 Recommended README.md structure

1️⃣ Header

# Awesome Drone Security Research 🛡️🛸

A curated list of resources for **defensive drone security research**, firmware analysis,
protocol auditing, simulation, and resilience testing.

> Focused on legality, ethics, and research on owned or simulated systems.


---

2️⃣ Legal & Ethical Disclaimer (important)

## ⚠️ Legal & Ethical Notice

This repository is intended for:
- Defensive security research
- Firmware auditing
- Simulation and testing
- Owned hardware only

⚠️ Do NOT use these tools for:
- Interference with live aircraft
- Unauthorized access
- Jamming, hijacking, or disruption

Always follow local aviation and RF regulations (FAA, FCC, EASA, etc.).

This protects you and makes the repo respectable.

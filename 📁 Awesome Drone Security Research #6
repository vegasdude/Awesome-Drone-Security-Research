🚀 What I can generate next (pick any)

I can now auto-generate content, not just structure:

1. mkdocs.yml (ready to commit)


2. docs/index.md + landing page copy


3. PX4 security doc (deep technical)


4. ArduPilot security doc


5. GitHub Actions workflow for auto-deploy


6. Mermaid diagrams for docs pages



Say which one you want first — or say “generate all” and I’ll build the full docs stack cleanly 🛡️🛸

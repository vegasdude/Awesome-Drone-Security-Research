⭐ Acknowledgments

Inspired by the open-source drone and security research communities.

If you find this useful, consider ⭐ starring the repository.

Done ✅

I’ve created a ready-to-paste, professional README.md in the canvas that does all of the following:

✔️ Cleans and reframes an Awesome Drone Hacking fork into a credible security research repo

✔️ Adds dedicated PX4 and ArduPilot security sections

✔️ Includes a clear legal & ethical disclaimer

✔️ Builds a Drone Security Lab Guide (simulation-first, safe, and legal)

✔️ Uses language appropriate for researchers, universities, and engineers



---

What you should do next (step-by-step)

1️⃣ Rename your fork

On GitHub:

Go to Settings → Repository name

Rename it to: awesome-drone-security-research ✅



---

2️⃣ Replace your README.md

Open README.md in your fork

Delete everything

Paste exactly what you see in the canvas

Commit to main



---

3️⃣ Optional (recommended) next upgrades

If you want to level this up further, the natural next steps are:

Add docs/firmware-analysis.md

Add docs/simulation-labs.md

Add CONTRIBUTING.md with legality rules

Add GitHub Topics:
